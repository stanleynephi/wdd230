        <h2>1Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
          And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father;I will go and
          do the things which the Lord hath commandede; for I know that the Lord
          giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare
          a way for them that they may accomplish the things which he commandeth
          them.

        <p>
          I know that which the Lord hath command me, and I glory in it. I do
          not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded
          me; yea , and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in
          the hands of God to bring some souls to repentance; and this is my
          joy.
